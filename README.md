## Kapcode About

Welcome to Kapcode! We believe that powerful technology should be accessible, straightforward, and open. Our journey started with a simple goal: to design and build our own software that is easy to use, following core principles of **simplicity and open-source design.** We are purely a product company, focusing our efforts on creating innovative, foundational tools—like efficient Macro automations and comprehensive 2D game templates, and releasing them to the world.

## Kapcode Services

We craft practical, powerful software, ranging from productivity macros to foundational 2D game templates.
